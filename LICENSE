Basecalc is free software, just like the answer to life, the universe, and everything. It's licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3), because we believe in the power of open source to drive innovation across the galaxy.

### What this means for you:

1. **Freedom to Use**: You can use Basecalc for any purpose, be it calculating the odds of successfully navigating an asteroid field or determining the exact amount of Pangalactic Gargleblasters needed for a party.

2. **Freedom to Study**: You have the right to study how Basecalc works and adapt it to your needs. The source code is your playground!

3. **Freedom to Share**: You can copy and distribute Basecalc to your fellow hitchhikers, ensuring that no one in the universe is without a towel or a powerful calculator.

4. **Freedom to Improve**: You can enhance Basecalc and release your improvements to the public. Maybe you'll add a function to calculate the probability of improbability?

### The Copyleft Principle:

The GPL is a copyleft license, which means that any derivative work you distribute must also be licensed under the GPL. This ensures that the freedoms are passed on to all users of Basecalc and its derivatives.

### Why GPL?

We chose the GPL because we believe that software, like knowledge, should be free and open. By using the GPL, we ensure that Basecalc remains free software, even as it evolves and improves over time.
