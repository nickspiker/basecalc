## üöÄ Key Features

- **Arbitrary Base Calculations**: From Binary to Hexatrigesimal (base 2 to Z+1), because who knows what number system the others use?
- **Complex Number Wizardry**: Juggle real and imaginary numbers like a cosmic jester.
- **Precision to Rival a Neutrino Detector**: Adjustable digit precision for when you absolutely need to know the 1000th digit of pi in base 7.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Calculate the waves needed for your intergalactic surfing adventures.
- **Constants at Your Fingertips**: œÄ, e, and other mathematical celebrities are always at the ready.
- **Previous Result Recall**: Use '&' to reference your last calculation, perfect for building fractals in the terminal.
- **VSF Integration**: State-of-the-art data storage and retrieval using the Versatile Storage Format.

## üÜï VSF Integration

basecalc now incorporates the Versatile Storage Format (VSF) for state and history storage. This marks the first public appearance of VSF!

### What is VSF?

VSF (Versatile Storage Format) is designed for efficiency, security, and adaptability. It provides a complete and unified solution for storing and managing any type of data, from simple values to complex structures.

Key features of VSF include:
- Optimized for efficiency and compact size
- Built-in security and validity checks
- Transparent data exchange
- Unified metadata framework
- Spectral accuracy in colour and data representation
- Proof of authenticity and chain of trust
- Future-proof design for technological advances

In basecalc, VSF is used to store the calculator's state and history. Take a look and put VSF to use in your projects!

## üßÆ How to Use

1. Launch basecalc
2. Type your mathematical musings
3. Press Enter
4. Marvel at the results
5. Repeat until you've solved all of the universe's mysteries (or just your homework)

## üî¢ Entering Numbers

Numbers in basecalc are like tribbles - they come in all shapes and sizes. At least all that are allowed for 0-9 plus A-Z:

- Regular numbers: `42`, `@pi`, `4R3.6A74cg7FR`
- Complex numbers: `[3, 4]` (That's 3 + 4i for you Earth-dwellers)

Spaces, tabs, and underscores are ignored, so feel free to make your numbers as readable as a Vogon poetry book.

## üéõÔ∏è Commands

- `:base <digit>`: Switch bases faster than a Time Lord switches regenerations. Works for & too.
- `:digits <value>`: Adjust precision because sometimes you need more than 42 digits.
- `:radians` / `:degrees`: Toggle between radians and degrees, useful for both interstellar navigation and pizza slicing.
- `:help`: Summon the Guide (that's me!) for assistance.
- `:debug`: Peek behind the curtain of the mathematical matrix.
- `:test`: Ensure your calculator isn't suffering from a Babelfish infestation.
